description: "Real-time monitoring of agent execution"
---

The Web Viewer provides live observability into agent execution, showing screenshots, tool calls, and LLM interactions as they happen.

## Launching the Viewer

Start any task with `--watch`:

```bash
helios tasks/explore-desktop --watch
```

Then open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Viewer Interface

The viewer is organized into panels:

### Desktop/Screenshot Panel

- **GUI tasks**: Live VNC view of the desktop, updated in real-time
- **Headless tasks**: Latest screenshot (if any)

### Traces Panel

Shows the chronological trace of:
- Agent messages and reasoning
- Tool calls with parameters
- Tool results and outputs
- Verification status

### LLM Panel

Real-time monitoring of API calls:
- Per-request costs and token usage
- Running total cost in the panel header
- Input/output/cached token breakdown
- Time to first token (TTFT) metrics
- Request/response previews

### Status Bar

- Current task name
- Model being used
- Elapsed time
- Pass/Fail status

## VNC Interaction

For GUI tasks, you can interact with the VNC view:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **View only** | Watch the agent work |
| **Click** | Not recommended during execution |

<Warning>
Manual interaction during agent execution can interfere with the agent's actions. Use view-only mode when watching live runs.
</Warning>

## Example Session

Starting a GUI task with the viewer:

```bash
helios tasks/explore-desktop --watch
```

Output:
```
Task: explore-desktop
Model: gemini/gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025
Provider: docker

Starting web viewer...
→ Open http://localhost:8080

[Container] Starting cua-desktop...
[VNC] Desktop ready on :5900
[Agent] Taking initial screenshot...
```

The viewer then shows:
1. Initial desktop screenshot
2. Agent's plan to explore
3. Mouse movements and clicks
4. Application interactions
5. Final result

## Cloud Viewer URLs

When using Daytona cloud provider, the viewer URL is a cloud-hosted preview:

```bash
helios tasks/gui-task --watch --provider daytona
```

Output:
```
Viewer: https://preview.daytona.io/sandbox-abc123/6080?token=xyz789
```

This URL can be shared with others to view the same session.

## Custom Port

If port 8080 is already in use, specify a different port:

```bash
helios tasks/my-task --watch --port 3000
```

Then open:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    Use the `--port` flag to specify a different port:

    ```bash
    helios tasks/my-task --watch --port 3000
    ```

    Or find and stop the conflicting process:

    ```bash
    # Find what's using the port
    lsof -i :8080

    # Kill the process
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Viewer shows blank screen">
    The container might still be starting. Wait for "Desktop ready" message:

    ```
    [VNC] Desktop ready on :5900
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VNC not updating">
    This can happen with slow network connections. Try refreshing the browser or using a wired connection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No screenshots in headless mode">
    Headless tasks don't generate continuous screenshots. You'll see tool calls and text output instead.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Without Web Viewer

If you don't need real-time viewing:

```bash
# Run without --watch
helios tasks/my-task

# Screenshots are still saved to output directory
ls output/my-task/screenshots/
```
