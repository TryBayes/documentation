description: "Test the web viewer without LLM costs"
---

Dev mode runs the web viewer with mock data, allowing UI development and testing without consuming LLM API credits.

## Usage

```bash
helios dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## What It Does

Dev mode starts the web viewer server with simulated:
- Agent messages and reasoning
- Tool calls and outputs
- Screenshots
- Progress updates

## Mock Data

Dev mode simulates a typical agent session:

```
[Agent] Analyzing the task requirements...
[Tool] bash: echo "Hello World" > /home/hello.txt
[Result] Command executed successfully
[Agent] File created. Verifying...
[Tool] bash: cat /home/hello.txt
[Result] Hello World
[Agent] Task completed successfully.
```

## Customizing Mock Data

For custom mock traces, modify the dev mode implementation in `src/helios/server/app.py`.

## Web Viewer Development

The web viewer frontend is located at:

```
src/helios/server/helios-viewer/
├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── components/
│   └── ...
├── package.json
└── ...
```

### Running the Frontend Separately

For hot-reload during frontend development:

```bash
cd src/helios/server/helios-viewer
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts a Vite dev server with hot module replacement.
